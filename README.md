## Abstract

The goal of this lab project is the implementation of a simple FIR-filter on a FPGA and its employment in an audio system obtained using a PMOD I2S2. Our task is to write down the VHDL source code that will be synthetized and implemented in the hardware.

The top entity implemented is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:top_scheme}. The filter block communicates with both the PC and the PMOD. Input data, digitized by the PMOD, are retrieved through a I2S receiver, filtered, and then sent back through a I2S transmitter; filtered data are also sent through a UART transmitter to the PC.
